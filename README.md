# Chehab_cpp_project
Project: MinHeap <br />
Programming Language: C++ <br />
Class: Data Structures and Algorithms
Description: This project helps with demonstrating how the MinHeap data structure works using C++.  <br />
The heap.h file was created to contain the data structure as a struct and declaring the operations such as ExtractMin, BuildHeap and Heapify. <br />
The main.cpp contains all the code to implement these functions after user input. <br />
A Makefile has been provided to aid with the running of this program. <br />
25 test cases were used for verifying the program's functioning.
