Project: MinHeap \n
Programming Language: C++
Class: CSE 310 - Data Structures and Algorithms by Dr. Xue
Description: This project helps with demonstrating how the MinHeap data structure works using C++. 
The heap.h file was created to contain the data structure as a struct and the operations such as ExtractMin, BuildHeap and Heapify.
The main.cpp contains all the code to implement these functions after user input.
